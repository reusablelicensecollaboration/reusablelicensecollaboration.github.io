<h1>Types of Licenses</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A license is a legally recognized grant of permission, which allows one party (the licensor) to grant rights to another party (the licensee). Licensing is the act of offering a license. Licenses are used by governments, companies, organizations, and individuals in a wide variety of ways. The type of license most people are familiar with is a driver's license, through which the government grants drivers permission to use public roads. There are many other types of licenses though such as Copyright licenses, Patent licenses, software licenses, and hunting licenses. Licenses can fall into more than one category too. For example, a software license might also be a form of Copyright license.</p>

<h2>Creation, and Re-use</h2>
<p>Anyone can write a license, but typically one will hire a lawyer to. As experts they should be able to craft a safer, more effective document. A license may be written explicitly for use by the licensor, or it may be designed allow re-use by others. An example of this would be #######. Such a license will often have details specific to the licensor, and usually don't grant any permissions to the license text (e.g., permission to redistribute it). This makes it difficult, or impossible for others to apply that license to their own situations. On the other side of the spectrum, permissive licenses typically are designed to be generic, and grant permission to redistribute the license text. This makes them very easy for other people to use them for their own licensing needs.</p>
